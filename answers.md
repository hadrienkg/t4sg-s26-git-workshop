1. Git is the local version control system, allowing the user to track code/version changes, while GitHub is a cloud-based software where developers can collaboratively deal with version control and store code in hosted repositories.
2. Version control is important because it allows developers to track their changes in their projects, as well as create separate workflows for collaboration with different features.
3. To view a branch's commit history, use git log.
4. To list all the branches in your local repository, use git branch. To list all the branches in the remote repository, use git branch -r.
5. To prevent specific files and folders from being commited to a repository, you should create a .gitignore file, where you can list the specific files/folders that you don't want to be included in your commits to the repository.
